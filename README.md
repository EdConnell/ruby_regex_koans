Regular Expression Koans
========================

A series of tutorials on Regular Expressions.

Learn how to write, read, and use Regular Expressions by completing or correcting
code to make failing Unit Tests pass. Each Koan includes a series of Unit Tests
which illustrate Regular Expression principles and techniques. I have made an effort
to avoid making forward references in the tutorial sequence, but there are enough
back references to earlier Koans that it would be best to complete the Koans in
the order presented.

Ruby's Regular Expression engine is very similar to that of many other
programming languages. It differs only in esoteric details.

To practice, to try out some code before using it in your program, or just to play around,
[rubular](http://rubular.com) is a fantastic Regular Expression resource.  This web tool should be in the Bookmarks list of every programmer.
